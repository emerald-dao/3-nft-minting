## 🚩 Challenge 3: NFT Minting

🎫 Setup your own NFT collection and minting site while learning the basics of the Flow blockchain and Cadence. You'll use:
- The local Flow emulator to deploy smart contracts. 
- The local Flow dev wallet to log into test accounts.
- A template Next.js app with sample scripts and transactions to interact with your contract.

🌟 The final deliverable is a DApp that lets an admin create an NFT Collection and display available NFTs for purchase on a minting site. Users will be able to see their purchased NFTs as well.
